## 01 02 - Bootstrapping the Project

make sure you add the following to the Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'spring'
```

```bash
$ rails new tutspolls
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec spring binstub --all
```

```bash
$ vi Gemfile
:g:^#
:g::normal dd
```

## 2 1 Creating Polls

```bash
$ rails generate scaffold poll title
$ bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
```
Head over to following url: http://localhost:3000/polls

Go to _app/assets/stylesheets/application.css_ and the following:

Instead of just adding

```css
 *= require bootstrap
```
This worked for this application instead below _app/assets/stylesheets/application.css_:
```css
*= '_bootstrap'
```
Add this to _app/assets/javascript/application.js_
```javascript
//= require bootstrap-sprockets
//= require rails-ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
```

```bash
$ rake log:clear
```
Now we add the following to _app/models/post.rb_
```ruby
validates_presence_of :title
```
Now we can edit the current poll by remove the title and we get the following message:

```
1 error prohibited this poll from being saved:

Title can't be blank
```

Go to _/config/routes.rb_ and add the following:

```ruby
root 'polls#index'
```

Now go to http://localhost:3000/

Convert _app/views/layouts/application.html.erb_ to haml, there is html2haml gem but I used the following site: http://htmltohaml.com/

Copy current layout and paste the results.

Created a new folder: _app/views/application/&#95;nav.html.haml_

Make sure you go to the correct version of Bootstrap that matches the version that is provide within bootstrap-sass-3.3.7.gem

Go to [Bootstrap Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar)
